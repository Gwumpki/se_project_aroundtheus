Intro

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. Here I have created this site to be responsive and change depending to different screen sizes.This project was made using HTML, CSS, Figma, and made to be responsive to differing screen sizes.

Images

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
